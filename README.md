# CommitLens - Git Change Visualization Tool

CommitLens is a powerful tool that provides natural language explanations of git diffs, making it easier to understand changes between branches or commits. It uses OpenAI's GPT models to generate clear, human-readable summaries of code changes.

## Features

- **Natural Language Explanations**: Clear summaries of git diffs.
- **Branch Comparison**: Ability to compare any two branches in the repository.
- **Uncommitted Changes Summary**: Summary of current working directory changes.
- **Commit Range Summary**: Summary of changes from a specific commit to HEAD.
- **Raw Diff Mode**: View raw git diff with added statistics.
- **Preview Mode**: Check token count and estimated cost before sending to OpenAI.
- **Markdown Formatting**: Proper formatting and syntax highlighting in the terminal.
- **Environment Variable Support**: Configuration using a `.env` file.
- **Model Selection**: Choose between different OpenAI models.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Git
- OpenAI API key (for natural language explanations)

## Installation

### Option 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alessandrodorazio/commitlens.git
cd commitlens
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 2: Install as a package

```bash
pip install commitlens
```

Or directly from the repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/alessandrodorazio/commitlens.git
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the same directory as the script with your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable directly:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

### Compare Two Branches

To compare two branches and get a natural language explanation of the differences:

```
commitlens compare feature-branch
```

This will compare `feature-branch` to your current branch.

You can also specify the base branch:

```
commitlens compare feature-branch main
```

or if you cloned the repository without installing:

```
./commitlens.py compare feature-branch main
```

### Summarize Uncommitted Changes

To get a summary of your current uncommitted changes:

```
commitlens summary
```

You can also summarize changes from a specific commit to the current HEAD:

```
commitlens summary --from <commit-hash>
```

For example:
```
commitlens summary --from 797b3398a
```

This will show you a summary of all changes that have occurred since that commit.

### Options

Both commands support the following options:

- `--raw`: Show the raw git diff output instead of a natural language explanation. This option doesn't require an OpenAI API key. The raw output includes a summary of the total number of commits, files changed, and lines added/deleted.

- `--preview`: Show token count, estimated cost, diff statistics, and a list of commits without sending anything to OpenAI. This is useful to check how large the diff is, see which commits are included, and estimate the cost before proceeding with the natural language explanation. When using with `--from`, the list includes the starting commit.

- `--no-color`: Disable colored Markdown formatting in the terminal. By default, the tool renders the output with syntax highlighting and formatting.
